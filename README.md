## Drug Combination Simulator (DCS)

DCS is a program written to enhance the computer simulated medical product development pipeline. This pipeline uses chemical dosages and effects from research articles and different databases to calculate multi-compound synergistic, antagonistic, and additive results.

* Inspiration for this project comes from a lack of freely available software to distinguish between synergistic and antagonistic drug leads in silico. In silico drug discovery saves time, money, and more importantly lives. We would like for our program to enhance the drug discovery pipeline.
