## Drug Combination Simulator (DCS)

DCS is a program written to enhance the computer simulated medical product development pipeline. This pipeline uses chemical dosages and effects from research articles and different databases to calculate multi-compound synergistic, antagonistic, and additive results.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

##### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

###### Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

####### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

######### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

########## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

* Inspiration for this project comes from a lack of freely available software to distinguish between synergistic and antagonistic drug leads in silico. In silico drug discovery saves time, money, and more importantly lives. We would like for our program to enhance the drug discovery pipeline.
